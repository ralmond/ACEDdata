<h2>Data from ACED field trial</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>ACED (Adaptive Content with Evidence-Based Diagnosis; Shute, Hansen
and Almond, 2008) is a Bayes net based assessment system which
featured:  (a) adaptive item selection and (b) extended feedback for
incorrect items.  This data contains both item level and
pretest/posttest data from a field trial of the ACED system.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>data("ACED")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>ACED contains 3 primary <code>data.frame</code> objects and some supplementary data.
</p>
<p>All of the data tables have two variables which can serve as keys.  <code>SubjID</code> and <code>AltID</code>.  
Either can be used as a primary key in joins.  Note that the first two digits of the <code>AltID</code> 
gives the session (i.e., class) that the student was in.  Note also that students in 
the control group have only pretest and posttest data; hence they do not appear in 
<code>ACED.items</code>, <code>ACED.scores</code> or <code>ACED.splitHalves</code>.
</p>
<p><code>ACED.scores</code> is data frame with 230 observations on 74
variables.  These are mostly high-level scores from the Bayesian
network.  
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>Cond_code</code></dt><dd><p>a factor giving the experimental
condition for this student, the levels are 
&ldquo;adaptive_acc&rdquo;, &ldquo;adaptive_full&rdquo;, &ldquo;linear_full&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;control&rdquo;.  Note that there are no control students in this data set.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Sequencing</code></dt><dd><p>a factor describing whether the sequence of items
was  <code>Linear</code> or <code>Adaptive</code></p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Feedback</code></dt><dd><p>a factor describing whether the feedback for
incorrect items was <code>Extended</code> or <code>AccuracyOnly</code></p>
</dd>
<dt><code>All_Items</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector giving the number of items
in ACED</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Correct</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector giving the number of items
the student got correct</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Incorr</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector giving the number of items the
student got incorrect</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Remain</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector giving the number of items not
reached or skipped</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ElapTime</code></dt><dd><p>a difftime vector giving the total time spent
on ACED (in seconds)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The next group of columns give &ldquo;scores&rdquo; for each of the nodes in
the Bayesian network.  Each node has four scores, and the columns are
names <code>p</code><em>node</em><em>ScoreType</em> where <em>node</em> is
replaced by one of the short codes in <code>ACED.allSkills</code>.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>p</code><em>node</em><code>H</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector giving the probability
<em>node</em> is in the high state</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>p</code><em>node</em><code>M</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector giving the probability
<em>node</em> is in the medium state</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>p</code><em>node</em><code>L</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector giving the probability
<em>node</em> is in the low state</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>EAP</code><em>node</em></dt><dd><p>the expected a posteriori value of <em>node</em>
assuming an equal interval scale, where <code>L=0</code>, <code>M=1</code> and
<code>H=2</code></p>
</dd> 
<dt><code>MAP</code><em>node</em></dt><dd><p>a factor vector giving maximum a
posteriori value of <em>node</em>, i.e.,
<code>which.max(p</code><em>node</em><code>H, p</code><em>node</em><code>M, p</code><em>node</em><code>L)</code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p><code>ACED.skillNames</code> a list with two components, <code>long</code> and <code>short</code> giving
the long (spelled out in CamelCase) and short names for the skills is a character vector giving the abbreviations
used for the node/skill/attributes names.  
</p>
<p><code>ACED.items</code> is data frame with 230 observations on 73
variables.  These are mostly item-level scores from the field trial. 
The first two columns are <code>SubjID</code> and <code>AltID</code>.  The remaining columns
correspond to ACED internal tasks, and are coded 1 for correct, 0 for incorrect, and 
<code>NA</code> for not reached.
</p>
<p><code>ACED.taskNames</code> is essentially the row names from <code>ACED.items</code>.
The naming scheme for the tasks reflect the skills measured by the task.  
The response variable names 
all start with <code>t</code> (for task) followed by the name of one or more 
skills tapped by the task (if there is more than one, then the first one is
&ldquo;primary&rdquo;.)  This is followed by a numeric code, 1, 2 or 3,
giving the difficulty (easy, medium or hard) and a letter (a, b or
c) used to indicate alternate tasks following the same task model.
</p>
<p><code>ACED.prePost</code> is data frame with 290 observations on 32
variables giving the results of the pretest and posttest.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>SubjID</code></dt><dd><p>ID assigned by study team, &ldquo;S&rdquo; followed by 3 digits.  Primary key.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>AltID</code></dt><dd><p>ID assigned by the ACED software vendor.  Pattern is &ldquo;sXX-YY&rdquo;, 
where <em>XX</em> is the session and <em>YY</em> is a student with the session.</p>

</dl>
  
<p><code>ACED.Qmatrix</code> is a logical matrix whose rows correspond to skills (long names)
and whose columns correspond to tasks which is true if the skill is required for solving 
the task (according to the expert).
</p>
<p><code>ACED.QEM</code> is a reduced Q-matrix containing the 15 <em>evidence models</em> 
(unique rows in the $Q$-matrix).  The entries are character values with &quot;0&quot; indicating skill not needed, &quot;+&quot;   
indicating skill is needed and &quot;++&quot; indicating skill is primary.  The <code>Tasks</code> column lists
the tasks corresponding to this evidence model (1, 2 and 3 again represent difficulty level, and the
letters indicating variants).  The <code>Anchor</code> column is used to identify subscales for scale identification.
</p>
<p><code>ACED.splithalves</code> is a list of two datasets labeled &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo;.  Both 
have the same structure as <code>ACED.scores</code> (less the datas giving study condition).  These were created
by splitting the 62 items into 2 subforms with 31 items each.  For the most part, each item was paired with
an variant which differed only by the last letter.  The scores are the results of Bayes net scoring with
half of the items.
</p>
<p><code>ACED.pretest</code> and <code>ACED.posttest</code> are raw data from the external pretest and posttest given 
before and after the study.  Each is a list with four components:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>Araw</code></dt><dd><p>Unscored responses for students who took that form as pre(post)test.  The first
row is the key.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Ascored</code></dt><dd><p>The scored responses for the <code>Araw</code> students; correct is 1, incorrect is 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Braw</code></dt><dd><p>Unscored responses for students who took that form as pre(post)test.  The first
row is the key.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Bscored</code></dt><dd><p>The scored responses for the <code>Araw</code> students; correct is 1, incorrect is 0.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
 
<p>Because of the counterbalancing each student should appear in either Form A or Form B in the pretest 
and in the other group in the posttest.  Note that the A and B forms here have no relationship with the A and B   
forms in <code>ACED.splithalves</code>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>ACED is a Bayesian network based Assessment for Learning learning
system, thus it served as both a assessment and a tutoring system.  It
had two novel features which could be turned on and off, elaborated
feedback (turned off, it provided accuracy only feedback) and adaptive
sequencing of items (turned off, it scheduled items in a fixed linear
sequence).  
</p>
<p>It was originally built to cover all algebraic sequences (arithmetic,
geometric and other recursive), but only the branch of the system
using geometric sequences was tested.  Shute, Hansen and Almond (2008)
describe the field trial.  Students from a local middle school (who
studied arithmetic, but not geometric sequences as part of their
algebra curriculum) were recruited for the study.  The students were
randomized into one of four groups:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>Adaptive/Accuracy</code></dt><dd><p>Adaptive sequencing was used, but
students only received correct/incorrect feedback.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Adaptive/Extended</code></dt><dd><p>Adaptive sequencing was used, but
students received extended feedback for incorrect items.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Linear/Extended</code></dt><dd><p>The fixed linear sequencing was used, but
students received extended feedback for incorrect items.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Control</code></dt><dd><p>The students did independent study and did not
use ACED.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Because students in the control group were not exposed to the ACED
task, neither the Bayes net level scores nor the item level scores are
available for those groups, and those students are excluded from
<code>ACED.scores</code> and <code>ACED.items</code>.  The students are in the
same order in all of the data sets, with the 60 control students
tacked onto the end of the <code>ACED.prePost</code> data set.
</p>
<p>All of the students (including the control students) were given a
25-item pretest and a 25-item posttest with items similar to the ones
used in ACED.  The design was counterbalanced, with half of the
students receiving Form A as the pretest and Form B as the posttest
and the other half the other way around, to allow the two forms to be
equated using the pretest data.  The details are buried in
<code>ACED.prePost</code>.
</p>
<p>Note that some irregularities were observed with the English Language
Learner (<code>ACED.prePost$Level_code=="ELL"</code>) students.  Their
teachers were allowed to translated words for the students, but in
many cases actually wound up giving instruction as part of the
translation.
